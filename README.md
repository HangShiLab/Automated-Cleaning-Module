# Automated-Cleaning-Module
This automatic cleaning script for c-trap equipment enables dosage control of cleaning reagents and automatic start/stop.

This is just a simple version that automates single-step cleaning steps using the system's already open interfaces. We have also designed a cleaning module that enables fully automated cleaning tasks. Please contact us for more information.
